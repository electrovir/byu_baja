# Output Shaft Tachometer Test

## Nov 14, 2017

First test of instrumentation on the car.

### Details

  * **Vehicle**: 89 Car (2017 BYU entry to Baja SAE)
  * **Tested**: Tachometer

The Car's CVT wasn't installed on the car so we hooked up the tachometer sensor directly to the output shaft of the engine by taping it on with electrical tape.

### Results

Initially the reading went up to ``5600 rpm``. After it reached this value it got stuck on it. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong because all I needed to do was quit the app (fully quitting it from the Android *recents* menu). After doing this, the values weren't stuck and started making sense. After this, the engine maxed out at a little over 3500 rpm. **(Why isn't it 3800 rpm?)**

This shows that the tachometer sensor can read properly up to the speed this engine is rotating. However, there are software issues.
